        <p>Studies show that that website visitors spend an average of seven seconds or less on 90% of websites they visit.  This means you only have a few precious seconds to let them know who you are, what you do and why they should choose you.<br/>
            This is where my unique skills can bring you the results that you are looking for. I have experience in JavaScript, Python, Django and HTML,CSS for both small and large businesses.<br/>
